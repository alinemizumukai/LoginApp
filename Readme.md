# Intents in Android Using Kotlin
Project developed for the Mobile Applications Development Course offered by ARINTER | CPS using Android Studio to develop Android apps with Kotlin.

#

The purpose of this project is to create an application from scratch that uses intents to facilitate navigation from one screen to another and pass data between activities or across applications.

We used a simple login form that passes the username data to a welcome screen when the password is correct or navigates to an access denied screen when the password is incorrect.
